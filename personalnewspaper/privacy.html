  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 9, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how this service (“Service”) handles information in connection with a daily SMS brief
    (“Daily Brief”) delivered each morning.
  </p>

  <h2>Who May Use This Service</h2>
  <p>
    This Service is intended for a single authorized user only. <strong>Only a user with the name “Tyler Carberry” is permitted to use the Service.</strong>
    If you are not Tyler Carberry, do not use the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>What This Service Does</h2>
  <p>
    The Service sends a Daily Brief via text message each morning to a phone number provided by the authorized user.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII).</strong></p>
  <p>
    The Service is designed to operate without collecting or storing PII beyond what is necessary to deliver a text message.
  </p>

  <h2>SMS Messaging and Your Phone Number</h2>
  <p>
    To send you texts, the Service necessarily uses a destination phone number. We do not use your phone number for marketing,
    advertising, or analytics, and we do not sell or share it except as needed to deliver messages through our messaging provider
    (for example, Twilio).
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use information only to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>deliver the Daily Brief by SMS, and</li>
    <li>process opt-out requests (for example, STOP).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Opting Out</h2>
  <p>
    You can opt out at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to any message. After you opt out, the Service will stop sending messages.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
  <p>
    We may use third-party providers to deliver messages (for example, Twilio). These providers may process message delivery metadata
    as part of providing the service (for example, routing and delivery status).
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to retain the minimum information needed to operate the Service. If any logs exist, they are limited and used only for
    troubleshooting and reliable delivery.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective Date” at the top will reflect the latest version.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>

    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact: <strong>[YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS]</strong>

  <p>
    <strong>Note for Twilio:</strong> This Privacy Policy is provided because Twilio requires publicly available policies/terms for many messaging use cases.
